      <h2>Climate Change Overview</h2>
      <p>
        New York State has been experiencing the impacts of climate change due
        to the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The most prominent
        gases contributing to global warming include Carbon Dioxide (CO2),
        Methane (CH4), and Nitrous Oxide (N2O). Each of these gases has a
        different global warming potential and contributes to environmental
        shifts in unique ways.
      </p>

      <h3>Carbon Dioxide (CO2)</h3>
      <p>
        Carbon dioxide is the largest contributor to climate change due to the
        combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. It traps heat in
        the atmosphere and has a long-term impact on temperature rise,
        contributing to melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and changing
        weather patterns.
      </p>

      <h3>Methane (CH4)</h3>
      <p>
        Methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, although it is
        less abundant. It primarily originates from agriculture, waste
        management, and energy production. Methane's impact on climate change is
        significant due to its high heat-trapping ability.
      </p>

      <h3>Nitrous Oxide (N2O)</h3>
      <p>
        Nitrous oxide is released through agricultural practices, industrial
        activities, and the combustion of fossil fuels. Although present in
        smaller quantities, it has a much greater global warming potential than
        carbon dioxide.
